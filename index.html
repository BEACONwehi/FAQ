    <summary><b>1. What is the purpose of this research?</b></summary>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to help researchers gain an understanding of how a diagnosis of brain cancer impacts an individual. Patients with brain cancer may develop significant symptoms that can impact their quality of life. This study will invite patients to share their lived experience of brain cancer, as well as their interaction with the healthcare system. The information collected will help to determine what supportive care needs are lacking and how these can be improved for better patient outcome.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary><b>2. What are the benefits to taking part?</b></summary>
   <p>After completing each survey, you will be able to download a summary of how your symptoms are changing over time using a symptom tracking tool based on the completed surveys. This may highlight areas for you where you require extra support. You may choose to share this information with your treating team and/or GP.
<br>In addition, your participation in this research may guide further research or expansion of the platform that could benefit other people with brain tumours in the future.
 </p></details>
 <details>
    <summary><b>3. How will my privacy be protected?</b></summary>
<p>There will always be a risk in maintaining privacy of your personal information. As such, appropriate security measures have been implemented in BEACON to protect your personal information. When you enrol in BEACON, you will be assigned a unique study identification number. With each completed survey, your stored data will be associated with the previously assigned unique identification number. The use of the unique identification number allows the replacement your personal information such as name, date of birth and address. This allows for all data analysis to be performed in a de-identified manner, meaning that no identifiable details will be used.  In addition, several safety measures have been implemented to protect your data against misuse, loss, and unauthorised access.
</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>4. How long will my data be stored for?</b></summary>
<p>There is no defined end date for the registry. This online platform has been designed to allow patients to follow their symptoms throughout the course of their life with a brain tumour to assess long-term outcomes and impacts. The registry will be a valuable resource for research into understanding brain tumours. New projects will be developed from the registry on an ongoing basis. Any new future research that does arise will be required to be ethically approved.</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>5. How can I access my information?</b></summary>
<p>Once you have consented for BEACON, you will be able to access the website at any time from either your phone or computer using your nominated username and password. A summary report to track your progress based on all the information you have contributed to BEACON will be available to you to download or print at any time. If you have any questions regarding this process, you may reach out to the study team at <a href="BEACON@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank"> BEACON@wehi.edu.au</a></p></details>
    <details>
    <summary><b>6. Will I be informed of the results of this research study?</b></summary>
    <p>Once this study is complete and the results are known, a written plain English summary of the results of the study will be made available through the BEACON online platform</p></details>
    <details>
    <summary><b>7. Will I be paid for my participation?</b></summary>
    <p>There are no additional costs associated with participating in this research project, nor will you benefit financially from your involvment in this research project </p></details>
    <details>
    <summary><b>8. How do I give my consent online?</b></summary>

<details>
    <summary><b>9. How do I change the details of my consent?</b></summary>
<p>Once you click the ‘Submit’ button on the final screen, the consent process is completed, and you are unable to make any changes. The details are locked to provide a legal record of your consent.
<br><br>If you want to change any of the details of your consent, you can click on the ‘Re-consent’ button. This will take you through the consent module again and the new details you provide will become the ‘Active’ consent version. All versions of consent you provide remain listed in the ‘My Consent details’ section of you BEACON account.
<br><br>If you wish, you can also withdraw your consent using the ‘Withdraw Consent’ button.</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>10. What if I don’t want to consent via the online platform, is there an alternative?</b></summary>
<p>Consent can be completed and submitted electronically via Add/Mange Consent tab in BEACON, or you can print out the consent form and send a scanned copy (or photographed) to <a href="BEACON@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank">BEACON@wehi.edu.au</a>. 
  <br>After submitting consent (applies to both online consent or consent via hard copy sent to <a href="BEACON@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank">BEACON@wehi.edu.au</a>), you will receive an email to acknowledge that your consent has been received and recorded in the BEACON database.
</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>11. Can I withdraw from the study?</b></summary>
<p>To withdraw your consent from the study, clinic on the “Withdraw Consent” button. Alternatively, you can request for a hard copy of the withdrawal consent form to be mailed to you at your nominated address. Upon completion of the signed withdrawal form, you will be required to email it to <a href="BEACON@wehi.edu.au" target="_blank">BEACON@wehi.edu.au</a>for the BEACON central study coordinator to upload your signed withdrawal form to the BEACON database. 
<br><br>Note: If you decide to leave the project, the researchers will keep the data that has been collected up until that time. This is to help them make sure that the results of the research can be measured properly. If you do not want them to do this, you should choose not to enter the study.</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>12. I withdrew my consent but have changed my mind, can I re-consent? </b></summary>
<p> Yes. You can re-consent at any time by clicking on the ‘Re-Consent’ button and adding new consent details.</p>
<details></details>
    <summary><b>13. How long will it take to complete the survey?</b></summary>
<p>We anticipate the surveys will take between 20 to 30 minutes to complete each time
<br><br>When you first sign up to BEACON you will be asked to complete surveys regarding (1) your diagnosis and treatment, (2) your supports, and (3) your quality of life. All data entered will be available for you to download each time you complete the survey.
<br><br>Every 3 months, you will be reminded via email to complete the quality-of-life survey. You may also update information about your treatment and supports if these have changed. 
</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>14. Can I get someone else to fill out the survey on my behalf?</b></summary>
<p>Yes, with your permission (controlled by access to your login details). 
<br><br>This may be a friend, relative or one of your treating doctors. The way in which the survey has been structured is such that the questions are all directed at the patient i.e. ‘When were you diagnosed?’. If the person is filling out the survey on the patient’s behalf this person should interpret them as if he or she was the patient and answer accordingly.
</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>15. What if I don’t have time to finish the survey?</b></summary>
<p>You do not have to answer all questions in one session. 
<br><br>If you need to take a break or leave the BEACON platform, you can save the responses you have entered and continue the survey at another time. Please note the survey will be locked after <b>7 days</b> at which time you would need to start a new survey. 
</p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>16. What if I make a mistake, can I go back and change my entry?</b></summary>
<p>Survey response can only be edited if the survey has not yet been submitted. Once submitted, survey response cannot be changed. </p></details>
<details>
    <summary><b>17. What if my contact details have changed? </b></summary>
<p>Login to BEACON and go to “Manage Contact Details", and update your information. </p></details>
